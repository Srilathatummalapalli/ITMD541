# Srila's ITMD441 Class Repository

Welcome to my **ITMD441 Class Portfolio**. This repository contains my work for the class, including my web development projects, code snippets, and labs. 

## About Me

Hi! I'm **Srila**, a Master's degree student with a strong interest in:
- **Software Engineering**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Software Architecture**
- **Artificial Intelligence**

In this course, I aim to build and enhance my web development skills while integrating what I learn in the field of software development and AI.

## Lab 1 - Intro Page

For this lab, I created an introductory webpage that serves as a landing page for this repository. It introduces me, my background, and my goals for the class. This project uses HTML and CSS with an external stylesheet.

### Features:
- A bio section with some background information about myself.
- Links and images (to be updated with more content as the course progresses).
- Responsive design and styling using CSS.

## GitHub Pages

Iâ€™ve enabled **GitHub Pages** for this repository so the web pages can be viewed live online.
